# Temperature-Prediction-of-Indian-Cities
Temperature Prediction using Time Series Analysis algorithm; predicting monthly average temperature using ARIMA model.

## Problem Statement 
The rising average temperature of Earth's climate system, global warming, drives changes in rainfall patterns, extreme weather, arrivals of seasons, and more. 
The primary effect of **global warming** is increase in global temperature.

## Objective
Since, global warming has such major effects we try to understand the past effects of global warming on temperature of four cities of India (Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata) and predict the temperature of the next twelve months using Time Series Analysis algorithm.

## Dataset
In this project, the Dataset used is the famous Kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/riturajsaha/temperature-of-different-cities-of-india).
