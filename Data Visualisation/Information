Here we visualize data using pivot table, that allows us to reorganize and summarize specific columns, with month as rows, years as column and temperature as the data.
We plot the temperature vs month graph for different years which shows us the trend over the past 10 years.
We take the mean of temperatues over vertical axis and try to recognize any kind of seasonality in the data.
we plot this graph and get the seasonality trend over the years.
